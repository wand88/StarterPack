# StarterPack
Starterpack is a frontend framework, I started, in need of bulletproof code Bootstrap has, but without all the overhead, for highly efficient and fully custom projects.

Packing **best practice** grid, very useful mixins, color palette map and function, few, most useful js plugins, and more.

**Entire HTML + CSS + JS = 33.7kb (gziped)** *(without Google font and jquery.min.js).*
In general, this setup, is *all you need for 85% of web projects*.
