// Start code here 



// --- Background Color classes based from map $palettes --- 


@include map-to-classes($palettes, background-color, '.bg', '-', '--'); 


// Here are all initially generated background-color classes (from template) 
// Note:
// Due to SCSS mixin complexity and SCSS code, words white and black, are turned into #fff and #000, instead of words, in class names.
// Base on that classes are bg-whites (so with white and black are in plural, to work), bg-blacks... 
// And bg-grey.., bg-primary.., bg-secondary.. They have intuitive naming, and are not bug affected.


// ie. 

// .bg-whites--base { background-color: #fff; }
